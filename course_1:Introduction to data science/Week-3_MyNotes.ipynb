    " Two-core data structures which are very similar, the one-dimensional series object and the two-dimensional DataFrame object. Querying these two data structures is done in a few different ways, such as using the iloc or loc attributes for row-based querying, or using the square brackets on the object itself for column-based querying. Most importantly, we saw that one can query the DataFrame and Series objects through Boolean masking. And Boolean masking is a powerful filtering method which allows us to use broadcasting to determine what data should be kept in our analysis."
